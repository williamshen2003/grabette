"""VLA fine-tuning launcher (pi05 / pi0_fast): stock `lerobot-train` with ONE
surgical fix.

Why this exists: when fine-tuning FROM a base checkpoint
(`--policy.pretrained_path=lerobot/pi05_base` or `lerobot/pi0fast-base`),
lerobot-train deserializes the processor pipeline SAVED ALONGSIDE that base
checkpoint instead of building one for YOUR run — so the pipeline carries the
base checkpoint's serialized settings rather than your policy-config
overrides and your dataset's normalization stats. (For pi0fast specifically
it also pins `action_tokenizer_name='physical-intelligence/fast'`, which is
unloadable on transformers v5 and the wrong tokenizer anyway — see
pi0fast/README.md.)

The fix: build the pipeline FRESH from the policy config (which carries your
CLI overrides) and the training dataset's stats, instead of deserializing the
base checkpoint's. Model weights still load from the base checkpoint; only
the data-processing pipeline is rebuilt. Everything else is stock
lerobot-train — all lerobot-train flags work unchanged.

Usage (full recipe in README.md):
  uv run python train.py --policy.type=pi05 \\
      --policy.pretrained_path=lerobot/pi05_base ...

# ── eval-set selection and best-checkpoint keeping ──────────────────────
#
# INLINED DELIBERATELY. `hf jobs uv run` uploads ONE script — there is no way to
# ship a sibling module — so a separate checkpointing.py would ImportError in the
# container. The tests load these helpers out of this file rather than keeping a
# second copy.
#
# Eval-set selection and best-checkpoint keeping for the pi05 launcher.
#
# Both exist because a 20000-step run on a 23046-frame dataset (sugar cup,
# 2026-09-04) overfitted from its FIRST eval point — eval_loss 0.0679 at step 1000
# rising monotonically to 0.2053 at step 20000 — and `--save_freq 10000` had saved
# only the two worst checkpoints. Two separate defects:
#
# 1. lerobot holds out "the last ceil(n * eval_split) episodes per task", i.e. the
#    contiguous TAIL of the recording session. Those episodes are maximally
#    correlated with each other, so the eval loss measures roughly one situation
#    repeated, and is both noisy and a weak generalisation signal. 8 of 150
#    episodes, all recorded back to back.
#
# 2. Checkpoints are saved on a fixed step cadence with no regard for eval loss,
#    and `push_to_hub` ships the LAST policy. There is no case where "keep the
#    worst checkpoint" is wanted.
#
# Neither is fixed by a fork: both hooks are module attributes on
# `lerobot.scripts.lerobot_train`, patched here the same way the launcher already
# patches `make_pre_post_processors`. Verified against the pinned revision
# (e40b58a8) rather than the workspace's lerobot, which is a different version.
