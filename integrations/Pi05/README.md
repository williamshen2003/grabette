# π0.5 for Grabette

Fine-tune [π0.5](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi05)
(`lerobot/pi05_base`, a ~2.3B flow-matching vision-language-action model) on
Grabette demonstrations, gate it offline, and run it on the robot through a
remote GPU. This is the **verified VLA recipe** for Grabette data: the
reference run (554 episodes, 3 tasks) grasped on its first real-arm episodes,
with the grasp trigger firing from raw policy output — none of the
inference-side aids the Diffusion baseline needs.

Companion to [`../DiffusionPolicy`](../DiffusionPolicy) — the **dataset
preparation is shared** (same converted 11D camera-local-delta datasets, 2D
gripper state, per-episode task strings). This integration adds training,
gates, and remote deployment.

> **Why π0.5 and not Pi0-FAST?** We tried Pi0-FAST first: its autoregressive
> action-token head **collapsed to a constant, input-independent action** at
> our data scale while its training loss looked perfectly healthy ($105 to
> learn that teacher-forced loss cannot see this failure). π0.5's continuous
> flow head was observation-conditioned by the first checkpoint (step 4000)
> on the same data. The pi0fast material is kept in [`pi0fast/`](pi0fast/)
> for reference; use π0.5.

## Requirements

- **Dataset**: produced by the shared pipeline
  (`../DiffusionPolicy/run_pipeline.sh --grasp-projection`): 11D Cartesian
  deltas + 2D gripper state + natural-language task strings, 480×360 wrist
  camera. **Run the pipeline with `--grasp-projection`**: without it the two
  gripper channels are raw joint angles, and a position servo replaying a
  demonstrated angle under-closes — the recorded angle is where the human's
  fingers sat while *pressing* the object. The projected dataset's channels are
  `(strategy, closure)`; commands below use `_graspproj` for it, and a
  `_cartesian` id is the unprojected output.
  See [`docs/grasp_projection.md`](../../docs/grasp_projection.md).
- **Training GPU**: A100-80GB class for batch 32 (bf16 + gradient
  checkpointing). An HF Jobs `a100-large` run costs ~$30 and ~12 h.
- **Inference GPU**: ~10 GB in fp32 (RTX 3090/4090/5090) — either on the
  robot machine itself, or anywhere else via
  [Ficelle](https://github.com/SteveNguyen/Ficelle) remote serving (in which
  case the robot machine needs no GPU at all).
- **One lerobot revision everywhere**: training, gates, and the Ficelle
  server must share the rev pinned in `pyproject.toml`. Bump deliberately.

## Workflow — cheapest test first, robot last

```
0. smoke_pi05_reference.py      free      is the pi05 port itself healthy?
1. 100-step training smoke      ~$2       does training run + checkpoint persist?
2. full training                ~$30      20k steps, inline eval split
3. smoke_generation.py          free      is the fine-tune observation-conditioned?
4. probe_task_sensitivity.py    free      does it read the task string? (multi-task only)
5. robot session                robot     evaluate.py — local GPU or Ficelle remote
```

### 0. Port smoke (before spending anything)

Verifies that the pinned lerobot revision generates sane, input-dependent
actions with lerobot's own known-good libero π0.5 checkpoint (~7 GB GPU):

```bash
uv run python smoke_pi05_reference.py
```

### 1–2. Training

No action-tokenizer stage: π0.5 is flow-matching, so there is nothing to fit
or verify before training (the FAST tokenizer workflow applies only to
Pi0-FAST — see [`pi0fast/README.md`](pi0fast/README.md)). Dataset in,
training out.

The flags are identical locally and in the cloud; only the launcher wrapper
differs.

**Local GPU** (A100-80GB class for batch 32; a 24–32 GB card needs a much
smaller batch and proportionally more steps — untested by us):

```bash
uv run python train.py \
  --policy.type=pi05 \
  --policy.pretrained_path=lerobot/pi05_base \
  --policy.empty_cameras=0 \
  --policy.gradient_checkpointing=true --policy.dtype=bfloat16 \
  --policy.compile_model=false \
  --policy.scheduler_warmup_steps=4000 \
  --policy.scheduler_decay_steps=100000 \
  --policy.scheduler_decay_lr=1e-5 \
  --dataset.repo_id=<user>/<dataset>_graspproj \
  --dataset.eval_split=0.05 --eval_steps=1000 \
  --steps=20000 --batch_size=32 --num_workers=4 \
  --output_dir=outputs/<task>_pi05 \
  --policy.push_to_hub=true --policy.repo_id=<user>/<task>_pi05
```

**HF Jobs (cloud)** — same account/token/credit prerequisites as the
DiffusionPolicy integration (see its README's cloud section). Two cloud
specifics: `--dataset.video_backend=pyav` (the Jobs image has no system
FFmpeg), and **keep `--output_dir` on container-local disk** — checkpoints
reach you through the Hub, not through the filesystem (see *Checkpoint
selection* below). Do **not** point it at a bucket mount: across three runs
the bucket retained only the 2 KB `config.json` of each checkpoint, never the
weights, and reading a checkpoint back off the mount twelve hours later raised
`OSError(EIO)` and lost the run's best model.

```bash
# $2 smoke first: verify training runs end to end
hf jobs uv run --flavor a100-large --timeout 1h -s HF_TOKEN \
    train.py -- \
    --policy.type=pi05 --policy.pretrained_path=lerobot/pi05_base \

    --steps=100 --batch_size=32 --num_workers=4 \
    --save_freq=100 --output_dir=/root/outputs/<task>_pi05_smoke
# then check `hf jobs logs`: "[checkpoints] eval-loss capture attached" at start,
# and "End of training" at the end. (Nothing is pushed on a smoke run.)

    --policy.scheduler_warmup_steps=4000 \

    --output_dir=/root/outputs/<task>_pi05 \
    --policy.push_to_hub=true --policy.repo_id=<user>/<task>_pi05
# lands TWO repos on the Hub: <user>/<task>_pi05_best (best on held-out eval,
# pushed the moment it is selected) and <user>/<task>_pi05_step20000 (the last).
# Nothing lands on the bare id — see "Checkpoint selection" below.
```

#### Checkpoint selection and what lands where

`train.py` wraps lerobot's trainer with two behaviours that are **on by
default** (both learned by hitting them):

- **Best-checkpoint keeping (`GRABETTE_SAVE_BEST=1`, default).** Every
  `--save_freq` checkpoint that follows an eval point is compared on held-out
  eval loss; the best one is pushed to `<repo_id>_best` **the moment it is
  selected**, and the final checkpoint is pushed to `<repo_id>_step<N>`.
  Nothing lands on the bare `<repo_id>`. Older checkpoints are pruned once the
  best has been pushed, so local disk holds at most two (~24.5 GB each: 9.35 GB
  weights + 15.13 GB optimizer state). Motivation: a 20k-step run overfitted
  from its first eval point and `--save_freq 10000` had kept only the two worst
  checkpoints. Keep `--save_freq` equal to `--eval_steps` (500 above) so every
  eval point is a candidate. `GRABETTE_SAVE_BEST=0` restores lerobot's stock
  behaviour (one push, to the bare id).
- **Diverse eval split (`GRABETTE_EVAL_SELECT=diverse`, default).** lerobot's
  stock split holds out the contiguous *tail* of the recording session, i.e.
  the last N correlated episodes. `diverse` picks the held-out episodes by
  farthest-point sampling on per-episode descriptors (start pose, grasp pose,
  path length, closure frame): 2× the spatial coverage on sugar cup.
  `GRABETTE_EVAL_SELECT=tail` restores the stock split; if the selector cannot
  read the episode data it prints `FELL BACK to lerobot's STOCK TAIL SPLIT` and
  continues.
- **Chunk-relative actions (`GRABETTE_CHUNK_RELATIVE=1`, default off).**
  Trains on UMI-style chunk-relative offsets instead of per-step deltas; needs
  relative stats in the dataset (`write_relative_action_stats`) and the guard
  refuses a stats/representation mismatch. Measured *not* better than deltas —
  see `docs/relative_actions_lerobot_native.md`. Deltas remain the default.

  **On HF Jobs this also needs `--with`.** The processor lives in
  `packages/grabette-chunkrel`, and `hf jobs uv run` uploads ONE script — so
  without it the job dies at `_install_chunk_relative` with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'grabette_chunkrel'`, after the GPU has
  booted. Add:

  ```
  --with "git+https://github.com/pollen-robotics/grabette@develop#subdirectory=packages/grabette-chunkrel"
  ```

  The package declares only numpy and scipy; torch and lerobot are
  host-provided and already in the job. Local runs need none of this — the
  workspace package is importable.

Eval loss is a weak selection criterion (on pick3 a 20k checkpoint at 1.71×
the minimum eval loss grasped 2/2); treat `_best` and `_step<N>` as two
candidates for the gates below, not as a verdict.

Two more operational notes:

- **The smoke run needs `--policy.push_to_hub=false`.** lerobot defaults
  `push_to_hub` to *true*, so without either that flag or a `--policy.repo_id`
  the job dies in `cfg.validate()` with *"'repo_id' argument missing"* — before
  training starts, and after you have already paid for the GPU to boot.
- **Enable wandb, or the loss curve is gone.** With `wandb.enable=false`
  (lerobot's default) the run logs only to stdout. HF Jobs logs are not
  retrievable after the job leaves the queue (`hf jobs logs <id>` → 404), and
  nothing survives the container beside the pushed checkpoints. We finished a 12 h /
  $30 run whose training and eval losses are **unrecoverable** — so the recipe's
  own success criterion (eval loss descending, reference 0.755 → 0.447) could not
  be checked at all. Pass `--wandb.enable=true --wandb.project=<project>` with a
  `WANDB_API_KEY` secret (`-s WANDB_API_KEY`), or accept that the only evidence
  you will have is the offline gates below. `train.py` pins `wandb<0.29`
  because 0.29 removed `Run.get_url()`, which lerobot's `wandb_utils.py` still
  calls — unpinned, enabling wandb is what *causes* the crash, on exactly the
  runs you wanted the curve for.

  Note also that `hf jobs logs <id>` truncates to a tail once a job has been
  finished for a while: a 12 h run fetched two days later came back as 55 KB
  (the last two evals only), while the same-length run fetched the morning it
  finished came back as 1.6 MB with all 50 evals. Pull the log promptly if you
  want it, and treat wandb as the only durable record.

Recipe rationale (matched to the verified `lerobot/pi05-libero` fine-tune):

| Ingredient | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| chunk_size / n_action_steps | 50 / 50 (defaults) | π0.5's native flow horizon — don't shrink at training; the eval replans on a prefix instead |
| cameras | your 1 real camera, `empty_cameras=0` | do NOT zero-pad camera slots (prime suspect in the pi0fast collapse) |
| LR schedule | 2.5e-5, warmup 4000, decay horizon 100k → ≈constant over 20k | **the three scheduler flags are mandatory**: lerobot's auto-scaled default decays to 2.5e-6 by 20k, 10× below recipe |
| eval split | `--dataset.eval_split=0.15 --eval_steps=500 --save_freq=500` | held-out loss each 500 steps on a *diverse* split (see above); expect it descending (reference: 0.755 → 0.447). On small tasks it can bottom out at ~1k steps — that is what `_best` is for |
| compile | **off** | `compile_model=true` + inline eval crashes (inductor layout conflict → illegal memory access at the first eval step) |
| image transforms | off | |
| action tokenizer | none | flow matching — no FAST stage, nothing to fit or verify |

`train.py` is stock `lerobot-train` with one surgical fix (see its
docstring): it rebuilds the processing pipeline fresh from your policy config
and dataset stats instead of deserializing the base checkpoint's.

### 3. Generation gate (before ANY robot time)

Training loss — even a clean held-out eval loss — **cannot detect a policy
that ignores its observations** (measured the hard way on pi0fast). Gate the
fine-tune on real dataset frames, at least two episodes per task:

```bash
uv run python smoke_generation.py \
    --checkpoint <user>/<task>_pi05 --policy_type pi05 --fp32 \
    --dataset_repo_id <user>/<dataset>_graspproj \
    --episodes 0 80 --frame 60 --task "<your task string>"
```

PASS = finite, sane-scale chunks that **differ across observations** (mean
|diff| ~0.02–0.06 on our data) and roughly track each frame's ground truth.
The collapsed pi0fast reference measured 0.000000. `--fp32` matters: the
pi05 port has a bf16 dtype clash in its flow path — fp32 for all inference.

**Execution-quality summary (`--episodes N`).** Beyond the PASS/FAIL sanity
gate, each held-out episode reports what the arm would actually do with the
chunk, for deltas and chunk-relative alike:

- `STEP err` — per-step command error in **mm** after the chunk is turned into
  the commands the server receives (deltas: as stored; chunk-relative:
  differenced). Comparable across representations. `chunk err` is the raw
  chunk-offset error (×1000) and is **not** comparable between the two.
- `snr` and lag-1 autocorrelation of the command error (chunk-relative
  differencing yields ≈ −0.5 by construction).
- gripper schedule: predicted vs ground-truth closure frame, its gap in mm
  along the trajectory, and the count of episodes where the model never
  closes. This is the number that separated models when eval loss did not.

Use `--chunk_relative` when the checkpoint was trained with
`GRABETTE_CHUNK_RELATIVE=1`; the script aborts on an 8-D/11-D width mismatch.
Our pi05 checkpoints are 4.14B params, so fp32 is **16.6 GB of weights**
before activations: use a ≥24 GB card, not the 16 GB the flag's help used
to claim.

**Chunk-relative checkpoints need `--chunk_relative`.** Two reasons the gate
cannot just run as-is on one:

- The chunk's reference pose *is* its first action, so relative action 0 is
  identically zero in all six pose dims for every training sample. Comparing
  two episodes' `select_action()` outputs therefore reads "input-INDEPENDENT"
  however good the policy is. The flag switches to `predict_action_chunk` and
  drops action 0 before differencing.
- The checkpoint's postprocessor ends with the inverse step, which needs a
  reference pose only the robot has. The flag strips it.

It also sharpens check 3: the ground-truth chunk is encoded the same way
training encoded it, so the gate reports a position error in **mm**.

```bash
uv run python smoke_generation.py \
    --checkpoint SteveNguyen/pick3_graspproj_chunkrel_pi05 \
    --policy_type pi05 --fp32 --chunk_relative \
    --dataset_repo_id SteveNguyen/pick3_graspproj_chunkrel \
    --episodes 0 100 --frame 60 \
    --task "pick up the red can" --task2 "pick up the cup"
```

Both episodes come from the same task there (eps 0–165 are "pick up the red
can"), so check 2 isolates the *scene* effect; `--task2` then measures the
*language* effect on the same frame. See step 4.

### 4. Language gate (only if you rely on task strings)

A multi-task fine-tune where **every training scene contains exactly one
object teaches the model to ignore the instruction** — the task is 100%
predictable from pixels, so the language channel gets no gradient. Measured
on our 3-task model: swapping the task string moved actions by 0.0047 vs a
0.0036 same-task sampling-noise floor (i.e. nothing). It will grab its
favorite object regardless of what you ask.

`smoke_generation.py --task2 "<other task>"` runs the same check **without a
Ficelle server**: it re-probes one frame with a second task string and scales
the result against a same-task re-sampling **noise floor**. The floor is the
whole point — pi05 is a flow model, so the same input does not give the same
output twice, and the 0.0047 above is only meaningful next to its 0.0036 floor
(1.3x = nothing). Verdicts: <1.5x FAIL, <3x WEAK, else PASS.

The standalone probe below additionally sweeps frames and needs the server:

```bash
# needs a Ficelle server running (step 5). All-local setup: start one on the
# same machine — uv run python serve.py --checkpoint <user>/<task>_pi05 \
#   --dtype float32     (websocket on :8000) — and pass localhost:8000.
uv run python probe_task_sensitivity.py \
    --policy_addr <ticket-or-host:port> \
    --dataset_repo_id <user>/<dataset>_graspproj \
    --episodes 80 300 --frame 60 \
    --tasks "pick up the red can" "pick up the mustard bottle"
```

If it fails and you need instruction-following, the fix is data: episodes
with **multiple objects in the scene** where the commanded one is grasped.

### 5. Run on the robot (local GPU or remote server)

Both modes use the same eval loop
([`openarm_gripette_simu/examples/evaluate.py`](../openarm/openarm_gripette_simu/README.md)
— see its README for the full flag reference and the start-pose calibration
rules, which apply to π0.5 exactly as to Diffusion). Pick by hardware:

**A. Robot machine has a ~10 GB GPU** — load the checkpoint locally, no
server needed:

```bash
uv run python examples/evaluate.py \
    --checkpoint <user>/<task>_pi05 \
    --task "<training task string>" \
    --grasp_projection on \
    --n_action_steps 15 --fps 30 \
    --home_joints <calibrated start pose> --start_gripper <demo first-frame> \
    --num_episodes 10 --ask_success session.jsonl --dump_obs /tmp/dump_pi05
```

**B. GPU is elsewhere** — serve with
[Ficelle](https://github.com/SteveNguyen/Ficelle) and point the eval at it.
On the GPU machine (clone Ficelle; `--transport iroh` works through NAT with
no VPN and prints a connection ticket; on a LAN/VPN you can use the default
websocket transport and a plain `host:port` instead):

```bash
uv run python serve.py --checkpoint <user>/<task>_pi05 \
    --dtype float32 --transport iroh
#   -> iroh ticket: endpointv1...
```

On the robot machine — same command as A with `--policy_addr` replacing
`--checkpoint` (needs the ficelle client:
`uv pip install -e '<ficelle>/client[iroh]'`):

```bash
uv run python examples/evaluate.py \
    --policy_addr endpointv1... --jpeg_quality 90 \
    --task "<training task string>" \
    --grasp_projection on \
    --n_action_steps 15 --fps 30 \
    --home_joints <calibrated start pose> --start_gripper <demo first-frame> \
    --num_episodes 10 --ask_success session.jsonl --dump_obs /tmp/dump_pi05
```

Deployment settings that matter (each traced to a measured failure):

- `--grasp_projection on` (both modes) — the dataset's gripper channels are
  `(strategy, closure)`, so the policy's last two outputs must be **decoded to
  angles** before they reach the servo. The default is `auto`, which works from a
  local checkpoint (it inspects the saved normaliser) but **exits on the remote
  path**: with `--policy_addr` there is no checkpoint to inspect, and guessing
  "raw" would send a closure of 1.0 as 1.0 *radian* — a partial close — with
  nothing in the log to say so. Confirm the startup line reads
  `(strategy, closure) -> decoded to angles`.
- `--grip_torque_limit 0.25` — an unset limit resolves to the server's ceiling
  (0.5), which crushes light objects: a full close drives into a hard stop and
  the torque cap is what stops the fingers. 0.25 was sufficient for everything
  tried. Check the held `load` in the log pegs near 250, not 500.

- `--fps 30` (both modes) — the **control rate**, and it is NOT the dataset's
  fps. Two different devices are involved: demos are recorded by the Grabette
  handheld (`camera_fps 46`, declared 50 in `info.json`), while at eval the
  images come from the Gripette gripper's own camera over gRPC
  (`stream_hz 30`). Set `--fps` to the **live** rate, not the dataset's:
  above it, a fraction of steps re-use an unchanged frame (at `--fps 50`,
  measured 26% stale, staleness p95 54 ms).
  Speed is the other half. Actions are per-frame position deltas, so the
  control rate scales wall-clock speed: 30 Hz walks the demonstrated path at
  ~0.65× demo speed. That is *free* accuracy-wise — `n_obs_steps = 1`, so the
  policy sees one frame plus current state and nothing in its input depends on
  the rate — and it helps twice over, because slower motion accumulates less
  integrator lead and stops tripping the arm server's contact guard
  (`--max_target_lead_mm`, tripped at 85–86 mm against its 80 mm cap when
  running 50 Hz). If you want demo-speed motion, raise the Gripette's
  `stream_hz` (OV5647 binned mode goes to ~42) and match `--fps` to it —
  don't just raise `--fps`.
- `--n_action_steps 15` (both modes) — replan cadence; the checkpoint's own
  value is 50 (`chunk_size 50`). 15 is inherited from ACT/Diffusion tuning,
  where short chunks fought open-loop drift; π0.5 was trained to emit 50, so
  treat 15 as a starting point, not a tuned value. The trade-off is
  measurable: sync mode stalls the loop for each replan (measured `infer` p50
  9 ms on cached chunk steps vs p95 175 ms at boundaries), so at 30 Hz a
  15-step chunk buys 500 ms of motion per ~175 ms pause — the visible
  "hesitation". Boundaries are also the only place the grasp can un-commit: a
  fresh draw at close onset is genuinely bimodal (pre-grasp closure ~0.2 vs
  commit ~1.0) and was observed dipping back for 3–4 steps before recovering.
  Fewer boundaries therefore help twice; going too far costs closed-loop
  authority (50 steps at 30 Hz = 1.7 s open-loop). ~25 is the sensible thing
  to compare against.
- `--grip_gain 1.3` (both modes) — if grasps slip: demo closes are recorded
  on the Grabette trigger linkage; a position-controlled servo chasing the
  same numbers squeezes less. Scales close depth around `--start_gripper`.
- The task string must be **exactly** a training task string.
- `--jpeg_quality 90` (remote only) — raw 480×360 frames are ~0.5 MB; over
  an iroh relay that was ~4 s per replan (burst-pause motion). JPEG →
  ~180 ms replans.
- Expect post-lift improvisation: end-at-lift demos define nothing after the
  hold, so behavior past that point is extrapolation.
