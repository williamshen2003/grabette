# Hugging Face Spaces

Two Hugging Face Spaces extend Grabette beyond the device: one turns your recordings into a LeRobot dataset without installing anything, the other lets you drive several devices as a fleet. Both use your Hugging Face account to decide what you can see and touch, so [log the device in](./dashboard.md#settings) first.

## Grabette SLAM → LeRobot

**[pollen-robotics/grabette-slam](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/grabette-slam)**

Takes a raw Grabette recording that lives on the Hub and gives you back a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset, pushed under your own account.

1. Sign in with Hugging Face.
2. Give it a **source** `repo_id` — the raw recording dataset you uploaded from the dashboard's **Datasets** section — a **target** `repo_id` to create, and a task description.
3. For every episode the Space runs the full pipeline in-process: expand the recording, run RGBD-inertial odometry to recover the trajectory, assemble a LeRobot v3 dataset, and push it to the Hub.
4. When it finishes you get a link and an embedded [LeRobot visualizer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lerobot/visualize_dataset) view of the result. The dataset has to be public for the visualizer to open it.

This is the same pipeline as the local one in [Getting started](./get_started.md#on-your-workstation) — the SLAM step is a compiled RTAB-Map binary, which normally runs in the `pollenrobotics/oak-vslam` Docker image. Spaces can't run Docker inside Docker, so this Space *is* that image, with the binary built in and called directly.

Use the Space when you don't want a local Docker and a multi-gigabyte pull; use the local pipeline when you want to inspect intermediate results, tune the checks, or work offline.

## Grabette Fleet

**[pollen-robotics/grabette-fleet](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/grabette-fleet)**

An operator dashboard and command broker for several devices at once. Recording a manipulation task from two viewpoints, or having several people record in parallel, is much easier when one start press starts everything.

```
operator (Space, HF login) ──queue command──▶ broker ◀──poll── device (Pi)
                           ◀──device status──                  (Bearer hf_token)
device data ─────────────────────────────────────────────────▶ HF dataset
```

Devices connect outbound with their Hugging Face token; the Space resolves the owner and groups devices by identity, so you only ever see and control your own. Once devices are grouped, a start or stop from *any* trigger — the physical button, the device's own dashboard, or the Space — is broadcast to the whole group.

Group synchronization is deliberately best-effort. If the device isn't grouped, isn't logged in, or the Space is unreachable, the local recording still starts and stops normally; it just runs solo. A sleeping Space delays nothing more than a few seconds.

### Running your own

To run the fleet on your computer with session-page recording-buffer telemetry,
see the [local fleet instructions](../../integrations/grabette-fleet/README.md).

One Space is one owner's fleet. To run yours, open the Space menu and **Duplicate this Space** — the OAuth setup is provisioned automatically — then point your devices at it:

```bash
GRABETTE_RELAY_URL=https://<your-username>-grabette-fleet.hf.space
```

Both Spaces run on the free CPU tier.

<Tip>

The `-test` variants of these Spaces are development deployments. Use the ones linked above.
