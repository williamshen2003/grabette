"""Does the attention follow the GRIPPER or the OBJECT?

The camera is mounted on the gripper, which makes this decidable rather than a
matter of taste: the fingers occupy the SAME image coordinates in every frame
of every episode, while the object's image position varies with where it was
placed and how far the approach has progressed.

So:

  attention on the fingers (or on a border/register artefact)
      -> nearly the same map every frame; a fixed template explains almost
         everything; the residual does not point anywhere in particular.

  attention on the object
      -> the map moves between frames, and the part that moves lands on the
         object's actual image position.

Measures both. Locates the object by its red cap, which is unambiguous in this
scene (the earlier "warm saturated" mask caught the table and a cardboard box
and was useless). Saves every grid to an .npz so the analysis can be redone
without re-running inference.

Ablation is off: this asks about the maps only, which halves the cost per
frame.
