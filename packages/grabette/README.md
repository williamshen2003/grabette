## Hardware

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| **Board** | Raspberry Pi 4 |
| **Primary camera** | RPi camera module, 1296x972 @ 46fps, fisheye lens (KannalaBrandt8) |
| **OAK-D SR** | Stereo RGB-D camera with on-board BNO IMU (200Hz). Provides the depth + IMU stream for SLAM — **required** for trajectory recovery on Grabette. Replaces the legacy BMI088. Toggled on demand (default off to save battery; turn it on when recording for the pipeline). |
| **Depth camera (alt.)** | Orbbec Gemini 305 — supported as a second source so the rig is not single-sourced. Passive stereo, no IMU; SLAM runs IMU-free. Opt in with `GRABETTE_DEPTH_CAMERA=gemini305` ([setup](#depth-camera-using-an-orbbec-gemini-305-make-install-orbbec-sdk)). |
| **Angle sensors** | 2x AS5600L rotary encoders (proximal + distal finger joints), one per I2C bus (`/dev/i2c-3` distal, `/dev/i2c-4` proximal) |
| **Button** | Grove LED Button (GPIO22 LED, GPIO23 button) — physical start/stop |
| **Speaker** | TLV320AIC3104 codec on the V2 HAT (I2S audio, control on `i2c-1` @ `0x18`, 12 MHz MCLK) — cues the recording start, the stop, the episode being written, and failures |

## Install

### Development (mock mode, no hardware needed)

> Part of the uv **workspace**: a bare `uv sync` here would build the *entire
> monorepo* environment. Always pass `--package` (root README → Development).

```bash
uv sync --package grabette
uv run --package grabette python main.py
# → http://localhost:8000
```

### Raspberry Pi

Tested on **Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (Debian 12)** and **Trixie (Debian 13)**. No specific Pi OS version is pinned — the Makefile target uses whatever system Python is at `/usr/bin/python3` (3.11 on Bookworm, 3.13 on Trixie).

#### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary> 1. Flash the SD card</summary>

1. Download the latest Raspberry Pi Imager from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">here</a>.
2. Plug in your SD card and select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) for Raspberry Pi 4.
3. Select the storage device then:
    - Set hostname (e.g., `R-grabette`).
    - Set username and password.
    - Set the WiFi SSID and password.
    - Enable SSH.
4. Click "Write" to flash the SD card.
5. Once the flashing is complete, eject the SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi
</details>


2. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then enable the V2 hardware overlays once and grant rights for network scanning (requires reboot):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh 
sudo cp config/config.txt /boot/firmware
make install-audio                 # builds the speaker's devicetree overlay — before the reboot
make install-netdev
sudo reboot
```

> The `sudo cp` above is the **only** thing that puts `config.txt` in place —
> no Make target writes it, because that file is this device's boot config and
> may carry per-device edits (`diff` it against the package copy before
> overwriting). `make install-audio` must run **before** the reboot: `config.txt`
> enables `dtoverlay=tlv320aic3104`, which is not a stock Pi overlay — the target
> compiles it from `config/overlays/` into `/boot/firmware/overlays/`, and warns
> you if `config.txt` doesn't actually enable it. Without either half the line is
> silently ignored and there's no speaker (everything else still works). See
> [Speaker](#speaker-audible-recording-cue-make-install-audio).

#### One-shot bringup
A grabette is built as either a **left** or **right** hand — the angle sensors are mounted mirrored, so the daemon needs to know which one this device is. Pick at install time:
```bash
make install-rpi HAND=right    # or HAND=left
uv run python -m grabette
```

> `HAND` is required — running `make install-rpi` without it fails with a clear error. The choice is written to `/etc/grabette/env` as `GRABETTE_HAND=<value>` and persists across reboots (sourced by `grabette.service`).

`make install-rpi HAND=...` does the following — automating the steps that are easy to get subtly wrong by hand:
- `sudo apt install python3-libcamera python3-picamera2 libcap-dev ffmpeg python3-dbus python3-gi` (the dbus/gi packages are system deps for the BLE WiFi service).
- Installs the OAK-D / Movidius USB udev rule (`/etc/udev/rules.d/80-movidius.rules`).
- Creates the venv with `uv venv --python /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages` — **both flags matter**:
  - `--python /usr/bin/python3` ensures uv uses the apt-managed Python (which owns `python3-libcamera`/`python3-picamera2`), not uv's own managed Python under `~/.local/share/uv/python/...`.
  - `--system-site-packages` makes the apt-installed `libcamera` and `numpy` visible to the venv.
- Runs `uv sync --package grabette --extra rpi --extra ui --extra hf` and verifies all imports succeed.
- Writes `/etc/grabette/env` with `GRABETTE_HAND=<value>` (preserving any prior `GRABETTE_*_SIGN` overrides).
- Runs `install-ntp` (below) so the device's clock is disciplined against a shared time service.
- Runs `install-audio` (below) so the HAT speaker's overlay + mixer init are in place.

Note: `install-rpi` does **not** install or start the systemd services — that's `make install-systemd` (next section).

### Depth camera: using an Orbbec Gemini 305 (`make install-orbbec-sdk`)

The depth camera is pluggable. `oakd` (Luxonis OAK-D SR) is the default and needs
no configuration; `gemini305` (Orbbec Gemini 305) is a second option so the rig
is not single-sourced on one vendor. `make install-rpi` already installs the
Orbbec udev rule, but the SDK and the setting are opt-in:

```bash
make install-orbbec-sdk                                            # pyorbbecsdk2
sudo sh -c 'echo GRABETTE_DEPTH_CAMERA=gemini305 >> /etc/grabette/env'
sudo systemctl restart grabette
```

Then **turn the camera on in the dashboard** — it is off by default to save
battery, and it is the same toggle whichever camera is configured. A successful
start logs `Gemini 305 ready: Orbbec Gemini 305 id=... fw=... conn=USB3.2`, and
the dashboard shows "Gemini 305".

If the camera is not found, the daemon says so and keeps running without it
rather than failing to start — check `lsusb | grep 2bc5` and, if the device is
present but not opened, re-run `make install-udev-orbbec` and replug it.

`pyorbbecsdk2` is installed with `--no-deps` on purpose: its declared
requirements (`opencv-python`, `numpy>=2.1.0`) exist for the SDK's bundled
examples and would shadow the system numpy that picamera2 links against. See the
comment on the target in the Makefile.

Two behavioural differences worth knowing before recording:

- **No IMU.** The 305 has none, so no `dcam_imu.json` is written and SLAM runs
  IMU-free. This is measured, not assumed: removing the IMU perturbs odometry no
  more than re-running the identical pipeline does. `metadata.json` records
  `"imu": null`, which means "known absent" rather than "not read".
- **Passive stereo, IR-cut, no projector.** It needs a lit, textured workspace
  and degrades first when either runs short. `GRABETTE_ORBBEC_IR_EXPOSURE_US`
  (with `GRABETTE_ORBBEC_IR_GAIN`) pins a shorter IR exposure to reduce motion
  blur at the cost of depth coverage; both default to 0, meaning leave the
  camera's auto-exposure alone.

Episode files are named `dcam_*` ("depth camera") regardless of which camera
recorded them, and `metadata.json.depth_camera` records the model, serial,
firmware and link. Older `oakd_*` episodes are still read as-is.

### Clock sync for multi-device recording (`make install-ntp`)

Synchronized group recording starts every device at a shared UTC instant that
each waits out on **its own clock**, so any clock offset *between* two grabettes
becomes an offset between their recordings. `make install-ntp` (also run by
`install-rpi`) drops `config/timesyncd-grabette.conf` into
`/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/grabette.conf`, pinning `systemd-timesyncd` to a
single coordinated anycast service (`time.cloudflare.com`) shared by all
devices — instead of the default `*.pool.ntp.org`, which resolves to a
**different physical server per device** (independent offsets → tens of ms of
relative skew). Verify with `timedatectl timesync-status` (look at `Server:` /
`Offset:`). For the tightest sync (sub-ms), run a local NTP server on the LAN
and point `NTP=` at it (see the comments in `config/timesyncd-grabette.conf`).

If the daemon logs `Using MockBackend` instead of `RPi hardware detected, using RpiBackend`, the venv setup didn't take — `make install-rpi` will fix it on a re-run.

### Recording write buffers

OAK depth uses a 256 MiB RAM write queue. OAK left/right and wrist H.264 video
each use 16 MiB, for a maximum of 304 MiB of queued/in-flight payloads plus
Python, camera, and codec overhead. These are allocated as frames arrive, not
reserved upfront. Independent workers compress/write while capture continues;
stopping waits for all accepted frames before finalizing the files.

After recording, the device dashboard's Status box shows each queue's peak
percentage and bytes used. These application queues are separate from the
original DepthAI receive queues (8 depth frames and 32 frames per OAK video).
Statistics persist in `metadata.json` under `buffers` and in the capture API.
Queue overflow or a write error sets `recording_complete: false`, displays a
warning, and preserves the affected raw recording rather than presenting it as
a finalized dataset input. A low queue peak does not prove the sensor/SDK never
dropped frames. The frame rates and depth compression setting are unchanged.

### Speaker: audible recording cue (`make install-audio`)

Each grabette beeps at **both ends of a take** — the audible counterpart of the
LED (blink = initializing, solid = recording), for when you're holding the device
and not looking at it:

- **ascending** beep at the instant the recording *actually* starts: after the
  OAK-D warm-up, once the sync clock is running and every stream is recording —
  not when the button is pressed. On a synchronized group recording all members
  reach that instant at the shared T0, so the whole rig beeps in unison.
- **descending** beep the moment the streams *stop saving frames*. That is the
  **start** of the ~1-2s mux, not its end: the stream stops flip their recording
  flag at once and only then write the mp4, so the beep marks the real end of the
  take rather than "episode written". You hear it while the daemon is still
  muxing (the LED keeps fast-blinking through that).

- **short high blip** once the episode is **fully written to disk**: the mp4
  muxes finished back in `stop_capture`, and `metadata.json` — written last, on
  purpose, as the marker that an episode is complete — has just landed. That is
  the point where the device can be moved or powered off. It arrives ~1-2 s
  after the stop cue, and it covers a real gap the LED leaves: the LED goes off
  as soon as the *streams* are down, deliberately not waiting for the JSON
  sidecars, so between the two there was nothing telling you the episode was
  actually complete. A failed write buzzes the error cue instead — an episode
  that didn't persist must not be something you discover later in the journal.
- **repeated triplet** when a capture command *fails*. This is the case that
  most needs sound: the failures happen where there is no screen — you press the
  button, the LED drops back to idle, and nothing distinguishes "it errored"
  from "the press didn't register". It fires from three places, so that every
  failure is covered exactly once:
  - `RpiBackend.start_capture` — every hardware failure, whichever trigger asked
    for the recording (button, dashboard, fleet);
  - the `CaptureScheduler` — a synchronized start/stop that fails *around*
    `start_capture`. On a group recording this device may be a **peer nobody is
    looking at**, and a peer that silently fails to join is the whole rig's
    problem;
  - the button listener — what never reaches the backend at all: the fleet
    refusing a group start (a peer offline), a scheduled start that never fired,
    a stop refused because hardware init is still in flight.

  A single failure is usually noticed by several of those layers. Rather than
  coordinating who owns the beep, the same cue simply won't replay within
  `CUE_DEBOUNCE_S` (1.5 s), so overlapping reports collapse into one buzz.

The four have to be told apart by ear alone, so they differ in direction, pitch,
count and length rather than in timbre — rising pair, falling pair, single short
blip, repeated triplet. In a normal take you hear: *beep-up* (rolling) → *beep-down*
(frames stopped) → *blip* (saved).

The hardware is a **TLV320AIC3104** codec on the V2 HAT, driven over I2S — the
same codec on the same HAT as
[microduck](https://github.com/apirrone/microduck_runtime/blob/main/rpi_setup/aic3104-init.sh),
there driven by a Pi Zero 2W. The devicetree overlay is board-independent and is
used unchanged (it binds `&i2c1` + `&i2s`, identical header pins on a Pi 4); what
is Pi-4-specific lives in `config/config.txt` and in how the card is addressed:

- `dtparam=audio=off` + `dtparam=i2s=on` — a Pi 4 also registers the `vc4-hdmi`
  cards, so the codec is **never a stable card index**. Everything therefore
  addresses it **by name** (`plughw:CARD=aic3104`): the daemon, the mixer-init
  script (`amixer -c aic3104`), and the `/etc/asound.conf` written by
  `install-audio`.
- No DKMS wait in the mixer init — on Pi OS `snd_soc_tlv320aic3x` is in-tree and
  autoloads from the devicetree match. Playback only: the HAT's onboard
  microphone routing is dropped, since grabette records no audio.

`make install-audio` (idempotent) does:
- `apt install device-tree-compiler alsa-utils`;
- adds `rasp` to the `audio` group (`/dev/snd/*` is `root:audio 0660`, and the
  daemon runs as `rasp`);
- compiles `config/overlays/tlv320aic3104-overlay.dts` → `/boot/firmware/overlays/tlv320aic3104.dtbo`;
- **checks** (never writes) `/boot/firmware/config.txt` for `dtoverlay=tlv320aic3104`
  and `dtparam=i2s=on`, and tells you exactly which lines are missing — an
  overlay in `overlays/` does nothing until `config.txt` asks for it;
- installs `scripts/aic3104-init.sh` → `/usr/local/bin/` — the codec boots with
  its line outputs muted, so **without this the card exists and plays silence**;
- installs + enables `aic3104-init.service`, which applies those mixer levels at
  every boot, ordered *after* `alsa-restore` (which can otherwise replay a stale
  mute) and *before* `grabette.service`;
- **only if the card is actually registered**, writes `/etc/asound.conf`
  (default card = `aic3104`) and applies the mixer levels straight away. The
  file is written only when you don't already have one of your own, and is then
  **checked**: if alsa-lib no longer loads, it's removed again — a malformed
  `asound.conf` makes alsa-lib discard its *entire* configuration, breaking
  every `aplay` whatever `-D` you pass. Pure convenience for
  `aplay`/`speaker-test` by hand: the daemon always names the card itself, so
  having no file is fine.

### No speaker fitted

The speaker is **optional** — a grabette without one is a supported build, not a
half-finished install. `make install-audio` is safe to run on it (everything it
installs is inert without the codec: an overlay whose I2C probe finds nothing
registers no card), and specifically:

- the daemon logs one `INFO` line at startup and every cue becomes a no-op —
  nothing in the recording path branches on the speaker;
- `aic3104-init.service` **succeeds** instead of failing. It checks the
  devicetree first: no codec declared → it returns in ~2 ms. That matters
  because it's a `Type=oneshot` ordered `Before=grabette.service`, so anything
  it waits for is added to the daemon's boot latency, and a non-zero exit would
  leave a permanently failed unit (and `systemctl is-system-running` =
  `degraded`) on a device that is working as intended;
- `/etc/asound.conf` is **not** written: aiming the default ALSA card at an
  absent device would break every other `aplay` on that Pi.

`config/config.txt` still carries `dtparam=audio=off` / `i2s=on` /
`dtoverlay=tlv320aic3104` on such a device. That's harmless — an unbound codec
just never registers — but it does mean the Pi's 3.5 mm jack stays off. Nothing
in grabette uses it; flip `dtparam=audio=on` back if you want it.

To turn the cues off on a device that *has* a speaker, set
`GRABETTE_SOUND_ENABLED=false` in `/etc/grabette/env`.

Check it:
```bash
aplay -l | grep aic3104                 # card registered? if not: config.txt + reboot
python3 scripts/test_speaker.py         # plays all four cues, via the daemon's own code path
sudo /usr/local/bin/aic3104-init.sh     # re-apply the mixer levels (if it's silent)
journalctl -u grabette | grep -i speaker   # "Speaker ready on '…'", or why it isn't
```
(`test_speaker.py` needs no venv — `grabette.hardware.sound` is stdlib-only, so
the system `python3` runs it before `install-rpi` has built anything.)
Turn it off with `GRABETTE_SOUND_ENABLED=false` (in `/etc/grabette/env`), or trim
the level with `GRABETTE_SOUND_VOLUME` — see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
A missing or unconfigured codec is never fatal: the daemon logs one line and
records silently.

#### systemd (auto-start on boot)

```bash
make install-systemd
journalctl -u grabette -f               # daemon logs
journalctl -u grabette-bluetooth -f     # BLE WiFi-setup service logs
```
`make install-systemd` installs **both** services (`grabette.service` and `grabette-bluetooth.service`), runs `ensure-ble-only` to set BlueZ to `ControllerMode = le`, then `enable --now`s them so they're up immediately and across reboots.

If you re-run `install-systemd` while the services are already up, `enable --now` does NOT restart them — issue `sudo systemctl restart grabette grabette-bluetooth` to pick up updated unit files.

To put the device on WiFi without a screen or SSH, use the BLE setup service — see **[docs/bluetooth_setup.md](docs/bluetooth_setup.md)**.

## Calibration

Before using Grabette, calibrate the angle sensors. For that, open completely the gripper (Both joints must be fully extended when opening), then run the calibration script:
```bash
python3 scripts/calibrate_angles.py
sudo reboot
```

## Usage

Once running (mock or on-device), open the dashboard at `http://<device>.local:8000`:
