# --- processing Space (raw → LeRobot conversion) ------------------------------
# Talking to the Space has three very different latency regimes, so ONE timeout
# for all of them is wrong: a single 60s cap used to apply to the whole session,
# which meant a cold start (minutes) was reported as a failed call. A sleeping or
# rebuilding HF Space does not refuse the connection — the HF proxy HOLDS it while
# the container boots — so the wake gets its own budget, outside the per-request
# timeouts. The URL is never hardcoded here: the fleet names the Space in the
# command's args, and the wake follows whatever it names.
_SPACE_WAKE_BUDGET_S = 300.0        # how long a cold start may take before giving up
_SPACE_WAKE_PROBE_TIMEOUT_S = 20.0  # one liveness probe
_SPACE_WAKE_RETRY_S = 5.0           # between probes
_SPACE_POST_TIMEOUT_S = 120.0       # /api/process, on a Space known to be awake
_SPACE_POLL_TIMEOUT_S = 30.0        # one /api/status poll (retried on failure)

# --- episode upload (raw dataset) ---------------------------------------------
# Three layers, because each catches what the one below it cannot:
#
# 1. SOCKET timeouts on the Hub client (grabette.hf.install_hub_timeouts).
#    huggingface_hub ships its httpx client with timeout=None, so a link that
#    DEGRADES rather than drops leaves a request waiting on a socket that never
#    delivers — forever, inside a thread nothing can interrupt. With per-operation
#    timeouts a stall raises inside the worker, hf_hub retries it, and the thread
#    DIES, leaving nothing behind. Covers everything that goes through httpx: the
#    JSON API and LFS uploads. It does NOT cover a xet upload, which is the
#    default path and does its HTTP in Rust — hence layer 3.
# 2. Retry with backoff here, so one bad minute doesn't sink a build that other
#    devices already spent twenty minutes uploading for.
# 3. A no-PROGRESS watchdog here, for a stall no socket timeout can see: a wedged
#    filesystem, or — the case that actually matters — a xet upload, whose bytes
#    move in a Rust HTTP stack that layer 1 does not touch at all. It lets the
#    COMMAND report back, so the fleet frees the device; the worker thread cannot
#    be killed, so it runs on.
#
# Layer 3 bounds SILENCE, never elapsed time. A total-elapsed cap cannot express
# the requirement, because any value it takes encodes an assumed throughput, and
# a healthy upload on a slower link then dies at the deadline — which is the one
# outcome we must never produce: an episode killed while it was still uploading
# fine. "No progress for N minutes" is the same guarantee against hangs with no
# assumption about speed, so a progressing upload runs as long as it needs to.
# The progress signal comes from grabette.hf's heartbeat (xet's own byte-level
# callback, plus httpx request/response hooks).
#
# Which is why uploads get their OWN executor. asyncio.to_thread uses the DEFAULT
# one, shared with the daemon's 50 Hz sensor poll, the OAK-D bring-up and
# stop_recording's mux — on a 4-core Pi that pool is 8 threads wide. An abandoned
# upload burning one of them competes for CPU with the H.264 encoders and the
# OAK-D drainers during a recording (hf_xet hashes and chunks in native threads),
# and enough of them would starve the capture path itself. Trading frame
# stability for upload robustness is not a trade worth making, so the two never
# share a pool: a stalled upload can only ever degrade uploading.
_UPLOAD_STALL_TIMEOUT_S = 900.0     # no Hub I/O at all for this long = wedged

                                    # so this only paces the CHECK, not the finish.
# Used ONLY when grabette.hf reports an INCOMPLETE heartbeat — some upload path
# is unobservable, so silence there proves nothing and the watchdog above must not
# rule on it. Partial coverage counts as incomplete on purpose: with only the
# httpx source wired, a xet transfer emits no marks at all and would read as a
# stall. Falling back to elapsed time accepts the false positive this whole design
# exists to avoid, because the alternative — no bound at all — is the original
