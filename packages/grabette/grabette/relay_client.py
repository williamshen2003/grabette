"""Device-side relay client — talks to the Docker fleet Space over HTTP.

The device connects OUTBOUND to the Space (NAT-friendly), authenticating with
its locally-stored HF token, and polls for commands. NAT-friendly outbound
polling avoids WebSocket reconnect/heartbeat edge cases, and the request
traffic keeps a free-tier Space awake.

The transport auto-adapts to the server: if the fleet long-polls (holds the
GET open until a command is queued), delivery is a network round-trip and the
client re-polls immediately; if the fleet short-polls (answers instantly), the
client throttles to poll_interval. No client config needed — the server's
LONG_POLL_S alone decides, so it can be flipped without touching devices.

Loop: register (also acts as heartbeat) → poll → execute → report results.
